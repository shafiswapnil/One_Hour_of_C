/*
 * 1 stdio.h is a standard IO library
 * 2 \n is a new line
 * 3 int main() is a main function,
   in one particular function, a program has only one Main function
 * 4 now, why we write int in front of main() function?
   -> main function will return an integer, that's why we use int in front of main() function.
      'return 0' is the example.
